`In triumph of the see
the air of no install
and heights of upper cots
and camp of binary aughts
in the fifteen years old
and laxative of genetics
the peal cases away

By the tenth apoplexy
in the courageous bed
in the corner outremer
the host slots star
Sylvia Renner portending
to be an institute, cleverly
curtained, of capital

And in Les, the rake
aforesaid away from today,
his flounce from sight
gets bet upon by the stymied,
old mannered implied,
who famish under surprise
and resurrection

Of long pours goes the 
tether of inof are
Safe to remain what is,
andor what ids may be is
Predestination slits 
the boil on the buttocks
into the voluptuary slit itself
The rent is much too koko`,

`Their bist old from work
Saved ours from the jets
The pusillan which embed imy
Gables to Centerton as soot poofs
Infart their chafes to be flat
Molten ruptures of the skin

IMO which said their finisheds
Would break wind’d
Had no Jesperson’s either
to be betoken to trucken had it
Left stints to slit

But of hats, letcks 
There’s no prepuce to fit my load
Triadic fervor
which itll be surprised to center
The Ptempted bets of antisets
in sexual assess

Imagined on the isthmus
Capitalismus favorite boychild
The brink of rupture of its pee
Sphinctered the spate of killing 
and the ends of FTI
Into one monomony

In spite populaced massacre
reams of symbols excrete
That echoes the pained face
Suffusion, granular eyes
from sold later O—
the bastardized cut forced sat

Friends suiciding the same Other friends had you fucked
In, you speaks, 
No place same ants - 
The termites benefit concert bets
Child pornography masturbated
Rich killed corpses fucked live`,

`Evening remains controversial
The name connotes a backdraft

Individualized being survived
where slight hoarfrost embeds

By Vermillion glands on earth.

`Tina, when the grief’s psychological explanation was underneath view, the whole story became piping clear what the deal was. Fear of dying, coupled with what people not even liked, more like hated, we’re about to do. But also loved ones being sliced throughout the home, without having to be able to clock out of work to save them. What was to do with their problems was the turgid gloat action, rijstaffel, and the crocus behind the door. What was clear to us was the part of the sternum that was hangin’ off, which matters taken to heart, physical might declare a frenulum of prepuce of purpose. The port’s wait, Ton, in part of the ship we we’re using, the fear, leakage, steam, and finishing pipe bit. Scot free doubt from part which nestled beneath the symptoms, the utter stagnathy that put through us into this complete avowal of driving to and from Walnut Creek psychotropathics, in the attempt to magnify events at South Lake Tahoe at some point in 1973. The grief counselors comply that there will be more to reduce therefore, within the scope his number was put through parts of a bit next to his mouth. Then for one swoop fell the part of the governor’s markedy, the implicit part of him that’s lint. A coming about to do was the preferred method. And then, times in the garage where there wasn’t any movement, had to enact sporting life to make any impression of the eyelids move. The careful support bear, keep locked up using wood debris to keep the cage realistic. The hay postponed the temporary hayee within the scope of what our horses wanted, which was the customary rider, carefree. Ducts swollen with dew, the proposal to ever survive lodged within that morning.`,
