#POETRON

##by Amanda Kielley

Poetron is an algorithmic and machine-learning-based poetry-writing assistant. Trying to write but feeling stuck? Plug it into Poetron and you'll get suggestions for that stubborn next word. Get a selection of word suggestions based on genre/school or author, or just a general suggestion based on a slice of poetry across genres and generations. 
Wondering who you write like? Checking 'auto' turns on auto-detection of your style! The author filter then dynamically changes based on what the neural network determines is your writing style. The suggestions also update to reflect whomever it thinks you are.

This is a project I set up in less than five days, so the code is a little less than excellent, but it functions. Incomplete features are currently hidden, but under construction.
The current dataset is also a bit lacking, but there is definitely room for expansion! I may do that in the future as well.

##IMPORTANT NOTE

Right now the auto-detection net is being (lightly) trained client-side because there is too much data to save and reload properly. I'm working on it. For now you'll have to wait a moment for the net to train on a very limited dataset.
